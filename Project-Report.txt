📂 **Introduction**  
In modern cricket, data analytics plays a pivotal role in decision-making, from player selection to in-game strategies. The Indian Premier League (IPL), being one of the most competitive T20 leagues, relies heavily on data-driven insights to gain a competitive edge. This project aimed to leverage AI and ML techniques to analyze IPL 2024 data, predict player performance, and optimize team selection, contributing to the growing field of sports analytics.  

By combining historical data with advanced predictive modeling, the project sought to uncover patterns and trends that could assist teams in making informed decisions. The use of machine learning and deep learning models allowed for a more accurate and dynamic analysis of player performance, setting the stage for future innovations in cricket analytics.

🛠 **Methodology**  
The project followed a structured, data-driven approach, as outlined below:  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Data was sourced from publicly available IPL 2024 datasets, including player statistics such as runs, wickets, strike rates, and economy rates.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Missing values were handled using mean imputation.  
   - Data normalization was performed using Min-Max scaling to ensure consistency.  
   - Categorical variables were encoded for model compatibility.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Conducted correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.  
   - Used visualizations like heatmaps and pair plots to explore data trends.  

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created new metrics such as Player Consistency Score and Match Impact Index to enhance model performance.  

5. **Model Selection**  
   - Evaluated multiple algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, and CNN.  
   - Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and computational efficiency.  

6. **Training & Testing**  
   - Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.  
   - Applied hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimization.  

7. **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Used metrics like RMSE, MAE, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to validate model performance.
